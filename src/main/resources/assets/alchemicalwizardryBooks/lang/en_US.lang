aw.entries.architect.intro=My name is Tiberius. I was a kid when the demons came for my village during The Wars. They ransacked the houses and turned the shacks into splinters, wielding fire and water to blast the land asunder. I woke up to some travelling merchants that were passing by, equipping the warriors who were futily trying to drive off the demons that still clawed the village. I was brought to a village nearby, where a magician named Magus helped tend to my wounds. The magic that he used was something that I had never seen before - it wasn't Thaumaturgy, nor Alchemy, and it was definitely not Botany. He winked at me once he saw that my eyes were open, holding his finger to his lips. Fast-forward several years, and I have learned almost everything from Master Magus, being his third student ever to master his arts. Against his wishes, I have recorded my research and put several wards and spells on this book. So welcome, apprentice. I am known as The Architect, and I am a Blood Mage. It took several years of pestering before I managed to convince Magus to teach me. He kept on telling me that, "Magic that uses the life essence of living beings requires patience and preparation in order to master it. One false move, go a little past your natural endurance, and you may find yourself taking a nice vacation in Tartarus." The thing was, I wanted to go there - I had some unfinished business with the demons. The process that Magus originally constructed required powerful artifacts that he constructed himself, but were rather lacking where teaching was concerned. After studying a bit of alchemy and the process of "Equivalent Exchange," I managed to construct myself an altar that would transmute items inside of its basin into new powerful forms. The only issue was that it needed a worthy catalyst, and so with a prick of the finger I set the Blood Altar alight!
aw.entries.architect.bloodAltar.1=To start any form of transmutation involving blood, you would need to construct a blood altar and a sacrificial knife, as well as have a solitary diamond in your possession. After placing the blood altar down, Magus advised me to be careful as I filled it slowly with my blood, and said that I would need to be really close to the altar (about a metre) for the knife to work. With about 2 buckets of blood in the altar, which Master Magus reminds me is about 10 hearts worth, I placed the diamond inside of the altar by activating it with the diamond in hand.
aw.entries.architect.bloodAltar.2=The blood dissipated in a cloud of red swirls as I waited for the atoms of the diamond to shift and reform. There were a few moments where the particles turned gray, which meant that the altar was empty and I had to hurry to fill it. After the diamond burst in a shower of red particles, what finally sat in the altar was a Weak Blood Orb.
aw.entries.architect.soulNetwork=One thing that I initially didn't understand was the overarching connection between the blood orb and myself. When I initially met Magus, I could see many sparkling strands branching off of him, flowing throughout his house and linking with intricate stones and runic drawings. I asked Magus about the strands, but he had no clue what I was talking about. It took three years of thorough research to finally find the answer, and when I brought my notes to him he was really impressed with what I have found. When you send power into the orb, the energy is transmitted from the strand connecting the orb and into the very soul of the person the orb is bound to. Similarly, and Magus managed to show this effect with several of his rituals, when you use something that drains energy it will drain the energy directly from the soul. The thing is that if you use an item whose owner has no energy left, the item will instead grab the requisite energy from the user of the item. Directly. From his or her life force. As such, the unit of measurement is called "Life Points," or LP. I experimented with this, and one heart equals 200 LP. I have christened this system to be the "Soul Network," and is used in all branches of Blood Magic indirectly.
aw.entries.architect.blankSlate=Magus is a master at rituals. His power in the intricate layering of stones and inks is unmatched. The problem is that these rituals are rather... static in nature. Sure, being able to call the bounty of the earth to the surface is all fine and dandy, but won't exactly protect you when you are on fire. To this end, I decided to link my soul network to powerful items that I have created. To start, I decided to transmute a piece of smooth stone in the Blood Altar with just 1kLP to create a blank slate.
aw.entries.architect.divination=The first thing I did was to arrange the blank slate with some reflective glass and my weak blood orb. Pouring my power into the configuration created a Divination Sigil, which I could link to my network and see how much power that my soul network holds. What is more, holding the sigil to the Blood Altar flooded my mind with information, giving me the knowledge about its current tier, capacity, and even how much it was holding. Happy with the sigil, I brought a fresh unbound one to Master Magus for him to use. When I took the divination sigil back in my hands and tried to use it to view his network, for some reason I could not gleam any information from him. I don't really see why this is, considering that I used this same method for other people and I saw that they had no power at all, but to gleam actually... nothing from Magus is strange.
aw.entries.architect.waterSigil.1=I've been training my body, lately. Master Magus told me that in order to extract most of my power, I have to get my mind, soul, and body into as perfect shape as possible. Even though my mind takes time to hone, and my soul requires methods I have yet mastered to strengthen, my body is something I can actively manage. No more cookies for me, apparently, since they have horrible saturation for the work I do. And it's hard to grow cocoa right now, anyways. The temperature is ridiculously high, and with it the humidity is pretty freaking low. Some bright spark of a thaumaturge got it into their head that it would be good to open up the Obelisk to the far north of the village, and because of it a large influx of taint spewed forth from the eldritch tomb. It looks like someone wasn't focusing enough on their sanity training! Thankfully Master Magus decided to head out to the site up north with a few stones and a new vat of ink, saying over his shoulder that he had a new ritual that he'd like to test to fix the problem.
aw.entries.architect.waterSigil.2=In the meantime, I was tasked to create something to fix our water problem. I thought about perhaps cooling the environment around the village in order to condense the water in the air, or perhaps find a way to create rain - neither of which I would be able to accomplish, because I'm sure that either task would take more than the 5 kLP capacity I currently have with my blood orb. So, I had to think small. At my desk, I mixed some dirt into the spare water I had for experimentation and started to paint on one of the blank slates I recently created to layer a bit of a base. Once I was satisfied, I took a bunch of buckets (to be safe in case that what I did would fail) and arranged them around the damp slate and then took my orb from the chest nearby. I then tapped the orb onto the slate, and the water started to boil and swirl out of the surrounding buckets, rushing into the slate! After a quick, bright flash, the new sigil lay steaming on the table in a puddle of water. Thankfully the sigil was what I needed. I could link it to my network and place water wherever I wanted by simply tapping it on the ground. The water was pricy, requiring a full 100 LP for each bucket's worth that I created in the world, but for an infinite supply of water, creeping upwards to 50 full buckets for my puny network was something that I desperately needed. It's just a shame that it started to rain an hour after I created the sigil.
aw.entries.architect.lavaCrystal=There was an explosion in the lab today as I was trying to work out a few more artifacts. When I tried to infuse a few buckets of lava with my power, and used some glass to contain the effect, the assembly simply burst into flames and flew me across the workshop. I wasn't really hurt, and thankfully my water sigil was used promptly to put out the fires, however it seemed that my experiment failed rather heartily. Apparently I needed just a little bit more time, however, since I got it to work a week after. By combining some glass and obsidian together with a few buckets of lava, and throwing in my blood orb and a diamond to hold it all together, the diamond was transmuted into a fiery crystal that seemed to... do nothing at all. I peeked out from behind the blast shield, since by then I learned that playing with lava was not the safest of hobbies, and gingerly linked the crystal to my network. As soon as the pact was completed, I felt a wave of heat emanate from the crystal, and promptly tossed it into a furnace before it could burn my fingers. I was unsuccessful on that front. The furnace immediately kindled, and the pork that was sitting in the top slot began to cook quickly. Quickly feeling a wave of nausea, I checked my network out and found that I had nothing left to offer. Once I pulled the blasted thing out of the furnace and stuffed it into a chest, the nausea subsided. So this Lava Crystal could work in any sort of furnace and feed off of the owner's network, but if the network was dry it would instead cause the owner to feel a hearty blast of nausea unless removed from the solid fuel-burning machine. Good to know, since now I know of a way to trade my services with the blacksmiths in the village.
aw.entries.architect.hellHarvest=Finally, the day that I have been waiting for the past 7 months has come. The "Hell's Harvest Festival" is a day that the village celebrates the creation of the first portal to the Nether a century ago. It's funny that when I ask the villagers why it is that we celebrate the formation of a portal to Hell, they simply laugh and say that I'll see when I finally go in. The portal was located in a vast stone cathedral, a three day's walk from the village on foot. Magus said that he'd meet us there, because he had a few things that he needed to prepare before actually going over to the Nether, but I was curious as to how he'd make it there in time - knowing Master Magus, he'd spend a day or two reading up on a new theory for a ritual and forget himself in his works. When we entered the hall, however, Master Magus was there already talking to one of the guards of the unlit portal, stowing away a gem into his pocket. I knew something was up, because I could see a strand connecting the gem in his pocket to both himself and one that trailed off back to the village. Not wanting to be distracted, I pulled out my wand (Master Magus insists on all of his apprentices learning of another field of magic, and Thaumaturgy has proved itself useful) and set alight the portal as was the custom of the newest member to the harvest. It seems that the harvest, however, was not exactly a trade. I saw giant stone walls and vast pumps throughout the land, grabbing all of the lava from the great pool below. A large collection of bound pigmen walked by, led away by someone in a full set of shining steel armour. Huge machines that processed the lava were emblazoned by the brands of industrialization: Thermal Expansion, BuildCraft, Greg Tech, and many other labels dotted throughout the base of operations. So much for a festival - it seemed that the Conglomeration, the governing body that oversaw all of the villages in the land, saw it fit to turn a civilization into a circus.
aw.entries.architect.lavaSigil=After accepting a few supplies from the farce, I walked back home by myself two days early. There were some things that I wanted to create, but wasting my time there would have been fruitless. Clearing my desk of debris charts of alchemical constructs, I set to work with a vat of magma cream that I brought with me, attempting to combine it with another slate. Casting my orb aside, I fished the lava crystal from my chest and combined it with the cream and some fresh buckets of lava - thankfully not from the Nether. Once the light faded, I picked up the new Lava Sigil that lay in front of me. What this sigil does is it siphons energy and uses the properties of the lava crystal to super heat rock, creating a source of lava wherever the wielder touches the ground. So, infinite lava, and infinite fire hazards. Unfortunately, it takes about 1 kLP per single use, which is a lot for my network as it stands currently. It looks like I need more power, but seeing that Master Magus is currently enjoying himself at the festival, I'm going to have to find a way to boost the blood altar myself.
aw.entries.architect.blankRunes.1=Of course! Runes! Why didn't I think of this earlier? The power of the altar itself comes from the structure of the components used to create it. The force of the diamond alone is not enough to create stronger materials through transmutation. What I need to do is construct several runes to extend the altar, and thus the altar's power. The only thing that I could do on such short notice is to take several blank slates (I have about 16 left) and quite a bit more stone and combine them with my Weak Blood orb.
aw.entries.architect.blankRunes.2=What came next was the hard part. After I made 8 runes for myself, I sat puzzling over the altar. "How could I extend this thing?" I asked myself. It took a few hours, but when I placed the 8 runes in the ground around the altar in a ring, I felt a strange reverberation in the air. Something felt like it awoke, as if the power in the surrounding environment doubled. Quickly, I grabbed my Divination Sigil and slapped it onto the altar, and focused into it to view the power of the altar. I was pleased to find out that the altar was finally at its second tier, which should open up many more transmutation recipes. The problem now, as I sank slowly into my bed to sleep after the long day, was to find out what I could now do. Although Magus was pleased with the upgraded altar, I was caught in a bind. I couldn't seem to do anything with it that the previous altar could not do. The first thing I did was I placed one of my leftover blank slates into the basin, and it promptly consumed 2 kLP worth of essence as it reinforced the structure. Although this Reinforced Slate was much more durable, this process appeared to make the slate no longer work with creating both the lava and water sigils, as well as making it a waste to use in additional rune creation.
aw.entries.architect.speedRunes=I can note, however, that when I combined one of the runes with a few more blank slates and some leftover sugar from the harvest it seemed to augment the altar even further. The sugar had to be laid in a configuration that mimicked a bow and arrow on top of the rune, and by doing so it created what I can dub a Speed Rune. What this rune appeared to do was increase the speed of the altar's processes, both the transmutation rate as well as the speed that a bound orb will consume the essence from the altar, by an additive 20% per rune. This tier doesn't seem perfect, however, since it seems that for the second tier only the four edge runes (not the corners) could be used as upgrade "slots" for the purpose of augmentation of the altar.
aw.entries.architect.apprenticeOrb=The "eureka" moment came when I accidentally dropped a few things on the floor of the lab. When I bent down to phish the items from the floor I noticed that one of the emeralds rolled right up to the altar, almost as if it longed to be inside of its basin. It occurred to me that if a simple diamond inside the altar created a weak blood orb, perhaps a much rarer gem would make a stronger version! Quickly fetching my knife from the table, I filled up the altar over the course of the day so that I could make sure I didn't mess anything up, and then dropped the emerald into the altar. The speed runes made sure that the transmutation took no time at all! Wow, those things work fast - I better make a note of removing the runes when I try to create more difficult items inside of the altar, because if I was not prepared it would have chewed through my supply in no time! After a few tantalizing moments waiting, the altar burst in a shower of particles and the new orb sat there, revolving on top of the altar. Master Magus must have heard my shout of exclamation, because he hurried over from his side of the house and helped me to my feet. Not noticing the pain in my palm from earlier, I reached for the orb and sealed it to my network. Master Magus then helped me to fill up the orb inside of the altar, and when we were done that day I had a total of 25 kLP inside of my network.
aw.entries.architect.voidSigil=After resting the rest of the day at the insistence of Magus, I returned to work this morning full of inspiration. While I laid in bed half awake, the thought struck me that so far I had managed to use sigils to create fluid. So why not make one that can remove it? My first attempts with things like glass bottles and bowls failed with all of them working for a brief moment, then returning to their old forms. It was almost lunch time when the thought crossed me that I used buckets for the first two, so why not here? Half an hour, six buckets, a bit of twine and a reinforced slate later I had my first void sigil.
aw.entries.architect.airSigil=While tending to our small farm a few days later, I noticed a bird land on our fence. I turned to face it as it flied off, and had a revelation as I watched how it flew. If I could use magic to create the gust of wind like that made by bird wings, I could fly through the air! After hastily finishing the days' chores, working out details in my head all the while, I rushed to my workstation to start work on what I have now dubbed the "Air Sigil". Using feathers and a Ghast tear as ink on a reinforced slate, I formed a sigil that on use creates a rush of air behind where you face to propel you forward. Flight using this sigil is fast, if a little pricey and hard to control, not like the flight provided by Magus's thaumostatic harness. Also, landing is a bit of a problem as I learned the hard way...
aw.entries.architect.sightSigil=I've grown a little annoyed at my divination sigil. While it is able to read the current tier and essence of a blood altar, that is ALL it can read. As a result, my current goal is to improve its design using my new blood orb. So far it is going well. The "Sigil of Sight" is able to read the buffers of the altar to give how much they store, as well as how far along a craft in the altar is and how fast it is using LP. The downside of this upgrade is that it loses the power to read the altar's tier or the users soul network, but so far this is an unavoidable loss. For now I'll settle with what it does now, and might try to improve it further later.
aw.entries.architect.advancedAltar=Even after all this time, I still don't fully understand the blood altar. Sure, I built the thing, but... It is almost like working directly with raw life essence has given it a bit of life of its own. After running a few experiments to try and make my life easier, I've noticed some odd behavior coming from it. First, I tried using some basic piping to extract life essence to store later to use for more pricey infusions. As it turns out, the altar doesn't like giving up its essence. I managed to get a bucket of LE out before it seemed to slow to a trickle feed, nothing more the 20LP a second. Further tests show that it has a "Buffer" tank that siphons off LP from the main tank, holding roughly 10% of the main tanks capacity. As I mentioned, it does this very slowly so piping is out of the question for now... A later test shows that it also doesn't like essence being piped in, as a similar restriction apples to imputing essence. I will defiantly need to find a way to improve this transfer rate... Another strange phenomenon about the altar is its "Hunger" for life. After the failure of the piping, I tried using a few regeneration potions from the local village to speed up the rate at which I recovered health. A normal or extended potion seemed fine, and were very effective for speeding up slate production. But a strengthened regeneration potion caused the altar to have a slight "Hum" about it, and I felt my energy being sapped by something. After talking with Magus about this, we have determined the altar senses the life flowing through us, and the potion makes the altars "Hunger" for this life create a sort of aura that causes you to lose energy akin to hunger. As a result of this, regeneration is still effective, but a sizable supply of food is needed for extended use to recover energy.
aw.entries.architect.fastMiner=I've decided to experiment with passive effects for sigils, since everything so far has been an active effect. While wondering through town looking for supplies, I noticed people cutting wood for a fire and some smashing stones to build a small fire pit. I keep coming back to how slow both of them were in my train of thought, then started going over ways to improve the tools. Then it hit me: Why improve the tools when you can improve the person? A few anatomy books and failed tests later, I hand the sigil of the Fast miner(Name pending) and two very tired arms. After activating the sigil, it speeds up muscle movements in the arms allowing you to break blocks far faster at a small LP cost every few seconds. I do need to keep reminding myself to turn it off when not in use, but the stinging pain of life essence being taken is always a quick reminder...
aw.entries.architect.soulFray=Today I pushed myself too far. I've gotten close a few times, but today was the first time I have passed out due to draining too much life essence. Magus was thankfully with me at the time, and moved me to a bed to recover. As I regained my senses, I noticed something odd about my soul network thread: They were thin and looked damaged. As I kept watching my threads, it seemed like they were slowly reforming and repairing themselves. I mentioned this to Magus, and we theorized that after coming so close to death my soul was still recovering from the shock. I made a sacrifice at the altar to test this, and it seems that this state effects how much life essence a heart is worth quite negatively with it only giving a tenth the normal amount.
aw.entries.architect.greenGrove=Today Magus showed me his green grove ritual, a way to speed up crops. Unfortunately, it is very static and has a small range, limiting its uses. To amend this, I've been toying with the concepts behind the ritual in an attempt to make it more portable. By creating an ink from oak saplings and sugarcane, then inscribing a rune on a reinforced slate I have created the sigil of the green grove. It seems a little slower and more expensive then the ritual form, but it can be carried on your person and acts like bonemeal when used on plants. While I had it active I could barely keep up with our farm, and by the end we needed to give a few of our neighbors some of the excess we didn't need. They all accepted it, but with varied degrees of reluctance.
aw.entries.architect.dagger=My work on sigils has slowed for now as I'm reaching the limits of what my little green orb can do after only two weeks. As a result, I have turned my attentions to other aspects such as runes to pass the time. Magus is currently out dealing with a large forest fire to the east of us, and the village is in a bit of a lull with nothing planed for several weeks. Right now my task is to slaughter a few chickens Magus brought home from the market to prepare on his return home, and it seems the perfect time to test an idea I've been thinking about for a while... I will not mark it here, just in case it is another false hope. Success! I've managed to perfect my idea for a new source of life essence. Before the only option was to cut ourselves to give our own life essence to the altar, but now we have a way to use other living things as a source. Unfortunately, it is a little gruesome and a bit "All or nothing" from them... Regardless, it works! ...I have realized that, in my excitement, I may have forgotten to write down what it is. I call it "The Dagger of Sacrifice", formed in a blood altar out of an iron sword and 3K LP. The dagger doesn't deal much in the way of damage. It doesn't need to, as its main purpose is to "Mark" a living thing for the altar which takes care of the rest by forcibly extracting their life essence all at once. Through my tests it seems that your common farm animal's life isn't worth nearly as much as a person, only giving 250LP regardless of where it comes from. While I set about cleaning the animals after the tests were done, a common zombie managed to sneak in the door I left open when bringing the chickens down here. As soon as I noticed it, reflexes that were being drilled in by Magus every morning kicked in and I managed to poke it with my dagger before it had a chance to hurt me. At first I thought nothing happened, then it fell to the floor as lifeless as it should have already been. I glanced at the altar, quickly noting that a zombie was worth 500LP. Looking over the fallen creature as it started crumbling, I noticed that some of the defenses Magus had set up took there toll on the zombie as it was burned and freshly cut in several areas... Seems that the amount of HP they have is irreverent to the altar, giving the same amount of LP regardless. As I finished preparing the meat to cook after disposing of the zombies ash(Which reminds me, I wanted to look up why this happens...), a very dark thought crossed my mind. The knife works by giving life to the altar. The dagger works by taking life forcibly from a target. What would happen if a human was marked by the dagger? I asked this to Magus, after showing him the dagger and telling him everything that happened. "In all honestly, I'm not sure. I have a theory, but I don't really feel like testing it..." I asked him to elaborate, so he told me the basics of it. It seemed that source of the life essence mattered with the dagger, since the chicken and zombie gave two different amounts, so depending on the person in question they would be split into one of three groups: Passive, Hostile, and Innocent. The passive would be like the chicken, only giving a little. The hostile would be the bandits, the thieves, the murderers. The ones who gave into evil, and now seek to hurt or steal from anyone. The unredeemed, and would probably be like the zombie. The final group were the innocents, anyone who doesn't fall into the first two groups. It was nothing but a guess, but we agreed that using the dagger on an Innocent villager would extract all of their life essence like ours. 2K LP, all at once... We also couldn't work out what would divide the passive from the rest, but it was only a theory so we put it to rest.
aw.entries.architect.sacrifice.1=Looking at these little speed runes, I have decided to see what else can I make. My goal isn't anything in particular, just improving it in some way. The speed rune was made with powdered sugar, so another type of powder should work... Redstone failed, gunpowder failed, glowstone... Glowstone worked. I currently have no idea what it does, all I know is it didn't fall to bits seconds after creating it so that is progress. The altar seems to accept it as a proper rune, so all that is left is to run a few tests in the morning. For now, I am tired and feel a bed calling me... I've run dozens of tests trying to find out what this new rune does, after two days of obsessing over this I finally noticed it. It slightly increases the amount of LP self sacrifice gives. When I said slight, I mean one rune increases LP gained by ten percent on an additive rate. For those who don't understand that, it basically adds an additional twenty LP per self sacrifice. If my theory is right, I should be able to make a similar rune for normal sacrifice... What else would the altar respond to?
aw.entries.architect.sacrifice.2=Well, if there is anything thaumaturgy and magic in general has taught me, it is that gold is a very good metal for magic. By simply replacing the glowstone in the recipe with gold ingots, a sacrifice rune is formed. It has the same additional ten percent addition per rune per sacrifice, meaning the more LP of the mob sacrificed the more LP the runes adds. This has got me thinking... The altar was constructed with both diamond and gold. It seems to resonate with the diamond enough to make the first blood orb, and even a second, so why not try making one out of gold? I'll need to revisit this idea later as a test run showed some reaction to a block of solid gold(I didn't ask Magus where he got it, and he doesn't seem forthcoming about these matters), but the altar couldn't cope with the strain needed to shape the block. Before catastrophic failure happened, a few safety precautions Magus and I had built into the altar triggered, stopping the transmutation before... Well, neither of us are really sure what would happen. But Magus said he has dealt with matters of unstable and untested magic, and knew most of them end with a crater in the floor(Hence the safety precautions). It has been a few days since the experiment with the gold block. Magus and I have been discussing what to do now, as the altar is getting bigger then the basement. Magus has suggested moving it to some of the lower basement floors, but considering just how large it might be in the future... I finally got him to agree to building it behind his home, as long as I helped put up a few wards and spells to keep people away. Currently we're planning out the structure and needed runes for upgrading. The current altar only has eight runes, but what I have planned will more then triple that number to twenty eight. The current limitation we suffer is the strength of the altar itself, as it can only take power from runes adjacent to it. My plan is to use something the altar is naturally attuned to as a way to not only increase the range of this effect, but act as a counter balance and stabilizing it to prevent it from becoming uncontrollable. For this to work, the blocks in question must be above the altar and an equal distance apart. We've run several tests and calculations, and have a layout in mind for this upgrade. Four pillars topped with glowstone blocks, twenty runes in sections of five, built one block down and two out from the last set of runes. In theory this should provide a huge boost in power to the altar without risking our safety(Well, more then we normally risk it), but until we test full scale I can't be sure. For now, we have a lot of runes to make. After much debate we've decided to invest in the "Self sacrifice" runes, as having a steady supply of mobs will be tricky. But now I face the issue of making dozens of reinforced slates... I need to think on this.
aw.entries.architect.bloodPack=It's so simple! I've discovered a way of obtaining LP for making slates that means I don't wait at the altar all day: The Blood letter's Backpack. Made with a modified leather chest-piece with a blank slate reinforced glass tank, it allows the wearer to gather LP by feeding it into the pack over time. Whenever the wearer has more than five hearts, the pack will drain their life and store it inside up to 10K LP to be dumped into an altar later. This pack does have two shortcomings, however. When the life essence is deposited into the altar, runes will have no bonus to the amount added. The second problem is that the altar will only accept LP from the pack when not performing a transmutation. Despite these limitations, it will prove quite valuable for simply allowing me to step away from the altar to do other tasks. This is a simple progress update, as it's been a few weeks since I last wrote in this journal. I've been making slow, but steady progress with assembling the slates needed for the runes and we're now halfway through. This isn't the only reason for the lack of entries, as I've been preoccupied with my research thorough thaumaturgy. An old friend of Magus has been visiting and happens to be a well versed thaumaturge, and he has been giving me pointers on how I could be doing better while Magus has been preoccupied in his library dealing with a mountain of paperwork. Now that Master Ridden has returned home, I hope to progress farther in making runes in the next few days.
aw.entries.architect.fivePeople=Or not, as it seems Fate has other far more interesting plans for us. Today we had a knock on our door while I was making the last of the runes, and after opening it was greeted by three apparent orphans. The two boys in the front looked like they were brothers, or at least close relatives. The girl hiding behind them on the other hand had a very different hair and eye color, so relation was unlikely at best. All of them were covered in dirt, clothing ripped, torn, and patched with various levels of skill. The one on the left had an old sword with a chipped blade on his side, was slightly thinner and taller then the his brother, had a few deep scars that looked recent, long and messy dark brown hair, and was looking at me with a kind poker face. The brother looked more muscled, and was staring at me with a very analytical eyes and a similar poker face, his hair was slightly shorter and lighter then his brother. From what I could see of the girl, she had a simple dress on that was almost caked in dirt and dried mud. The fabric near her elbows was becoming thread bare, and a large rip near the bottom of the dress exposed some of her right leg. Her hair was a light blond, almost pale white color, but the most shocking feature was her eyes... I haven't seen haunted eyes like that in years, and last time it was in a mirror. From the looks of them, all of them hadn't ate anything in days and seemed to have everything they own on their bodies or in the simple packs on their backs. I asked them if there was anything they needed, to which the elder brother said they were looking for master Magus. I called Magus to the door, visitors being a rare thing as it stands with ones who ask for him by name and not clearly mages being rarer still. Five minutes later we all sat in the main room, eating simple sandwiches I had prepared for us all at the request of Magus. Needless to say, this day was not going as expected. Magus spent the next few minutes practically interrogating the elder brother , asking questions on both of our minds. As it turns out the two brothers, Vlad and Demier, use to be caravan traders, eldest a alchemist with basic knowledge of potion brewing, younger with enough mana and training already to cast basic spells. The girl on the other hand had a story all her own. From what the brothers had managed to gather, her village was raided like my own was and she was evidently the sole survivor. What shocked me was when they said she was found wandering the ashs, demons having left hours before without so much as a scratch on her body. Vlad was with the traders when they found her, and he was forced to leave them if he wanted to help the girl named Bella. Their story seemed to win Magus over, as he told them he would try to do what he can for them.. Not long after that, Magus asked me to help him do some shopping for our new guests. On the way to the village, Magus asked me  what I thought of the three. "I can't say I believe all their story, but I also don't think their lying. Did you notice the girls eyes? Haven't see a look like that since...". Magus finished for me with "Your own?". I nodded at the dark memories of that time. We continued going over the details of their story, but we agreed that just leaving them in the cold wasn't an option worth considering. We decided to at least try to keep our recent endeavors into blood magic a secret from them, but when push comes to shove I think we might have to let them in on the secret. Magus let out a long sigh. "It's been years since I had to juggle this many apprentices at once. I'm going to need your help training them. But something tell me that we're going to be learning as much from them as they will from us..." I asked him why he felt that way, and he said it was just a gut feeling. I must say I had a similar feeling. Things like this don't happen without reason, and of all mages to come to they stopped at our door, something far easier said then done. An hour later we returned home, both our arms heavy with fabrics, food, and other necessities that we will need to take care of the new apprentices. I watched in amazement as the three ate, trying to make up for days with little food all at once. After that, Magus and I laid the three on various chairs and couches to rest, the strain of travel catching up with them. While Magus dug around looking for a few of his old things that we'd soon need, I started creating some new clothing from enchanted fabric for the three to replace their current worn and ratty clothing. Now that that is done, I should try to get some sleep. Something is telling me tomorrow is going to be quite busy. The Early this morning Magus and I started carving out the earth for the three new bedrooms, since the old ones Magus use to have had since been converted into a storage closet, a alchemy lab, and small study. It didn't take nearly as long as I expected with Magus using a few spells to clear away earth while I went behind using an equal trade foci to transmute it into stone brick before gravity caught on. Once that was done, Magus raised a few walls to separate the space into three rooms and a hallway. Only after that was done did I notice the three children had awoken, and were watching us as we worked. Magus told them that he had some spare furniture in some storerooms they could use, but sadly only knew of one bed. It didn't take long for them to decide Bella got the bed, the brothers would make do with a pillow and a blanket on the floor. After that we spent the rest of the day hunting for then moving furniture to their rooms, building little work areas and libraries for each of them. The following day was more of the same, with the evening filled with helping them find books to read from the grand library. Vlad grabbed as many alchemy books as possible, Demir took a few books on spell casting, and Bella took a Lexica botanica to read through. Later this evening, after the three had retired to their rooms, I sat in the main room with Magus, arms and legs aching from the heavy lifting of the last two days. I told Magus how I thought their rooms should be almost finished, and how I spent the last hour before they retired just answering seemingly endless questions. "I'm sure. I've gone through the same more then once, when I have apprentices new to magic. You were the same, I recall." I opened my mouth to protest, but closed it as I thought back to those days. I decided I probably was as bad as them, and left it at that. It's been just over a week, and the three have settled in nicely. They join Magus and I in morning exorcising, have started studying like true scholars, and have calmed the hungry nodes in their stomachs(Well, Vlad and Bella have. Demir on the other hand is another matter, but I feel he will always be like that.) Unfortunately, like true scholars and mages they've stumbled into places we didn't want them to go. Vlad has created a chemistry set that uses life essence from a blood orb as a fuel source, Demir has turned an old table into a way to use life essence to cast powerful spells, and Bella... She's left me questioning what I know about demons, after taming one and using a blood orb to bind it to her. All three of them have stumbled blindly into blood magic, and now I don't think we'll be able to stop them. Magus and I have agreed to give them a choice in whether they are blood mages or not, but I've seen the light in their eyes... I can't imagine any of them saying no. To seal their dedication to the art, we will have them make blood orbs of their own to use.
aw.entries.architect.tier3=Even with all the chaos of the last week I've managed to finish the altar construction, and it has been more successful then I predicted. With full access to twenty eight runes, each heart is now worth over seven hundred LP. I've already started prepping to try again with the gold block, having a few instant healing potions at hand. I got a brief glimpse with my sigil of sight, and this transmutation will take twenty five thousand LP to finish, over double what the altar can hold! Writing this down does give me an idea, however.... I'll need to look into it further once I have finished making this.
aw.entries.architect.magicianOrb=It was close, but I finished the orb today. I was down to the last of my three potions and barely had the strength left to hold the knife, but I pulled through and finished my shiny new blood orb! I've already used it to craft a few things I had made before, and extra lava and air sigil, and it handles it all with such ease! Now that this is finished, I have a small list of ideas to go through... To start off the process, I want a stronger slate. As it stands the reinforced type is cracking under the strain I'm starting to place on it. Well, I got a new slate type when I last upgraded the altar... Let's see if it works again. It does! A reinforced slate in a tier three altar with around five thousand LP makes a new slate... I'll call it an imbued slate for now, and come up with a better name later.
